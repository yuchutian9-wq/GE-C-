# GamesEngineeringBase Library Documentation

The **GamesEngineeringBase** library is a collection of utility classes designed to facilitate game development in a single header file without the need for any external libraries. This is designed for the MSc Games Engineering course at the University of Warwick. It provides functionality for window management, rendering, audio playback, input handling, and timing. The library is organized within the `GamesEngineeringBase` namespace and is licensed under the MIT License.

## Introduction

The **GamesEngineeringBase** library simplifies the setup and management of essential game components. It abstracts the complexities of DirectX initialization, sound loading and playback, image handling, and controller input, allowing developers to focus on game logic and design.

## Namespace Overview

All classes are encapsulated within the `GamesEngineeringBase` namespace to prevent naming conflicts and to logically group the various functionalities.

```cpp
namespace GamesEngineeringBase
{
    // Classes and definitions
}
```

## Classes

### Window

The `Window` class manages the creation and handling of a Windows application window with DirectX 11 rendering capabilities.

#### Key Features

- Window creation with customizable size, title, and fullscreen mode.
- DirectX 11 device and swap chain initialization.
- Input handling for keyboard and mouse events.
- Rendering support with a back buffer for pixel manipulation.

#### Public Methods

- `void create(int window_width, int window_height, const std::string window_name, float zoom = 1.0f, bool window_fullscreen = false, int window_x = 0, int window_y = 0);`
  - Initializes and creates the window with specified parameters.
- `void checkInput();`
  - Processes pending input messages.
- `unsigned char* backBuffer();`
  - Returns a pointer to the back buffer for pixel access.
- `void draw(int x, int y, unsigned char r, unsigned char g, unsigned char b);`
  - Draws a pixel at (x, y) with the given RGB color.
- `void draw(int pixelIndex, unsigned char r, unsigned char g, unsigned char b);`
  - Draws a pixel at pixelIndex offset with the given RGB color. Note pixelIndex is computed as (y * width) + x.
- `void draw(int x, int y, unsigned char* pixel);`
  - Draws a pixel at (x, y) using the color from the provided pixel array.
- `void clear();`
  - Clears the back buffer.
- `void present();`
  - Presents the back buffer to the screen.
- `int getWidth();`
  - Returns the window's width.
- `int getHeight();`
  - Returns the window's height.
- `bool keyPressed(int key);`
  - Checks if a specific key is pressed. Letter and number keys can be accessed via passing in the appropriate char, i.e. `keyPressed('A')` detects if the A key is pressed. Special keys can be accessed via the [Windows Virtual Key codes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes).
- `int getMouseInWindowX();`
  - Gets the mouse X-coordinate relative to the window.
- `int getMouseInWindowY();`
  - Gets the mouse Y-coordinate relative to the window.
- `bool mouseButtonPressed(unsigned int button);`
   - Checks if a specific mouse button is currently pressed. Accepts one of `MouseButton` enum as an input. That is `MouseLeft` for the left button, `MouseMiddle` for the middle button, and `MouseRight` for the right button.
- `int getMouseX();`
   - Returns the current X-coordinate of the mouse cursor within the window.
- `int getMouseY();`
   - Returns the current Y-coordinate of the mouse cursor within the window.
- `int getMouseWheel();`
   - Returns the mouse wheel’s current scroll value.
- `void clipMouseToWindow();`
  - Restricts the mouse cursor to the window's client area.

  - Loads a WAV file into the sound buffer.
- `void play();`
  - Plays the sound once.
- `void playMusic();`
  - Plays the sound in an infinite loop.

### SoundManager

The `SoundManager` class manages multiple `Sound` instances and provides an interface for sound playback.

#### Key Features

- Delta time calculation for frame-independent movement.

#### Public Methods

- `Timer();`
  - Constructor that initializes the frequency.
- `void reset();`
  - Resets the timer.
- `float dt();`
  - Returns the elapsed time since the last call to dt() or reset() in seconds.

### Image

The `Image` class handles image loading and pixel data manipulation using Windows Imaging Component (WIC).

#### Key Features

- Loading images in the following formats: PNG, JPEG, BMP, TIFF, DDS.
- Accessing pixel data with support for different channels.
- Alpha channel handling for transparency.

#### Public Methods

- `bool load(std::string filename);`
  - Loads an image file.
- `unsigned char* at(int x, int y);`
  - Returns a pointer to the pixel data at the specified coordinates. These coordinates are clamped to be within image bounds.
- `unsigned char alphaAt(int x, int y);`
  - Returns the alpha value of the pixel at the specified coordinates. These coordinates are clamped to be within image bounds.
- `unsigned char at(unsigned int x, unsigned int y, unsigned int index)`
  - Returns a the colour specified by index at (x, y) coordinates. Index should be between 0 and 2, where 0 == Red, 1 == Green, 2 == Blue
- `unsigned char* atUnchecked(unsigned int x, unsigned int y)`
  - Returns the alpha value of the pixel at the specified coordinates. This is faster than `at()` as these coordinates are *not* clamped to be within image bounds.
- `unsigned char alphaAtUnchecked(unsigned int x, unsigned int y)`
  - Returns a pointer to the pixel data at the specified coordinates. This is faster than `alphaAt()` as these coordinates are *not* clamped to be within image bounds.
